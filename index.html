        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the
            Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7500 BC). <br> Did you know that, The felids are a rapidly evolving
            family
            of

        <p>
            Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
            forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night
            and
            at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and
            composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when
            hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
